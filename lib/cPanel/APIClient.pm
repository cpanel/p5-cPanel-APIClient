=head1 NAME

cPanel::APIClient - L<cPanel|http://cpanel.com> APIs, à la TIMTOWTDI!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Create a L<cPanel::APIClient::Service::cpanel> object
to call cPanel APIs:

    my $cpanel = cPanel::APIClient->create(
        service => 'cpanel',
        transport => [ 'CLISync' ],
    );

    my $resp = $cpanel->call_uapi( 'Email', 'list_pops' );

    my $pops_ar = $resp->get_data();

Create a L<cPanel::APIClient::Service::whm> object
to call WHM APIs:

    my $whm = cPanel::APIClient->create(
        service => 'whm',
        transport => [ 'CLISync' ],
    );

    my $resp = $whm->call_api1( 'listaccts' );

    my $accts_ar = $resp->get_data();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

cPanel & WHM exposes a number of ways to access its APIs: different transport
mechanisms, different authentication schemes, etc. This library provides
client logic with sufficient abstractions to accommodate most supported
access mechanisms via a unified interface.

This library intends to supersede L<cPanel::PublicAPI> as the preferred way
to access cPanel & WHM’s APIs from Perl. It can also serve as a model for
similar client libraries in other languages.

=head1 FEATURES

=over

=item * Fully object-oriented.

=item * Can use blocking or non-blocking I/O. Non-blocking I/O implementation
works with almost any modern Perl event loop interface.

=item * Uses minimal dependencies: no L<Moose> &c.

=item * Extensively tested.

=item * Can run in pure Perl.

=back

=head1 CHARACTER ENCODING

cPanel & WHM’s API is character-set-agnostic. All text that you give to this
library should thus be encoded to binary, and all strings that you’ll receive
back will be binary.

This means that if you character-decode your inputs—as L<perlunitut>
recommends—then you’ll need to encode your strings back to bytes before
giving them to this module.

Use of UTF-8 encoding is B<strongly> recommended!

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 $client = cPanel::APIClient->create( %OPTS )

A factory function that creates a “client” object that your code can
use to call the APIs.

%OPTS are:

=over

=item * C<service> - Required. The service that exposes the API(s) to call.
This controls the class of the returned object. Recognized values are:

=over

=item * C<cpanel> - Function will return a L<cPanel::APIClient::Service::cpanel>
instance.

=item * C<whm> - Function will return a L<cPanel::APIClient::Service::whm>
instance.

=back

=item * C<transport> - Required. An array reference that describes the
transport mechanism to use. The first member of this array names the mechanism;
remaining arguments are key-value pairs of attributes to give to the
mechanism class’s constructor.

Currently supported mechanisms are:

=over

=item * L<cPanel::APIClient::Transport::HTTPSync> (C<HTTPSync>) -
Synchronous HTTP requests.

=item * L<cPanel::APIClient::Transport::CLISync> (C<CLISync>) -
Synchronous local requests via cPanel & WHM’s command-line API tools.

=item * L<cPanel::APIClient::Transport::NetCurlPromiser> (C<NetCurlPromiser>) -
Asynchronous HTTP requests via
L<Net::Curl::Promiser>, which can use any event loop interface.
As of this writing it supports L<IO::Async>, L<AnyEvent>, and L<Mojolicious>
out-of-the-box.

=item * L<cPanel::APIClient::Transport::MojoUserAgent> (C<MojoUserAgent>) -
Asynchronous HTTP requests via L<Mojo::UserAgent> (pure Perl).

=back

Which of the above to use will depend on your needs. If your application
is local to the cPanel & WHM server you might find it easiest to use
C<CLISync>. For HTTP C<NetCurlPromiser> offers the best flexibility
and (probably) speed, whereas C<MojoUserAgent> and C<HTTPSync> can run in
pure Perl (assuming you have L<Net::SSLeay>).

There currently is no documentation for how to create a 3rd-party transport
mechanism (e.g., if you want to use a different HTTP library). Submissions
via pull request will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

=item * C<credentials> - Some transports require this; others don’t.
The recognized schemes are:

=over

=item * C<username> & C<api_token> - Authenticate with an API token

=item * C<username> & C<password> - Authenticate with a password

=item * C<username>, C<password>, & C<tfa_token> - Authenticate with a
password and two-factor authentication (2FA) token.

=item * C<username> only - Implicit authentication, only usable for local
transports.

=back

=back

Depending on the C<service> given, this function returns an instance of
either L<cPanel::APIClient::Service::cpanel> or
L<cPanel::APIClient::Service::whm>.
